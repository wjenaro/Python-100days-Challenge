# This is just a simple list
mylist = [1, 3, 5, 8, 2]

# Print the list
print(mylist)

# Modifying an element in the list
# Note: The index 9 is out of range, so we will modify an existing index
# For example, changing the element at index 2 to 90
mylist[2] = 90

# Print the modified list
print(mylist)
